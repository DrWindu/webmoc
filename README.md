# webmoc
A javascript small-form audio player, inspired by moc (music on console).

The `player.html` file is a self-sufficient drop-in of the project.

The player itself expects an adjacent `music/` folder, which should contain a `playlists/` subdirectory with all available playlists in [M3U format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U).
